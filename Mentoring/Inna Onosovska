Inna Onosovska
QA Engineer in AB- SOFT

I liked working with Arsen. He is an enthusiastic, professional, and personable individual with a great sense of duty. 

Arsen proved to be a highly qualified Quality Assurance Engineer with leadership, personality, and good communication skills. He is very organized in his day-to-day tasks. You can rest assured, that when the task is accepted, it will be done on time.

He has plenty of good experience and a strong knowledge of QA processes and methodology. He mentored junior QA engineers. With his strong technical and analytical skills, he helped identify production issues, provide root cause analysis, and propose possible resolutions. Arsen will be always a valuable asset in any QA team. He is very enthusiastic in his field and can accept the challenge of a high-volume load.

I wish him success in all his future endeavors. I would be glad to work with Arsen again.
