QA Engineer in AB- SOFT

Arsen Buhaienko proved to be excellent as a deputy 
TL (team leader). From my point of view, 
replacing the TL in the RCV Int Front team, 
he successfully and effectively performed the 
duties of the TL, managed the process of undergoing 
regression testing, supply the connection between 
management and the team, coordinated the work 
of the team, paid special attention to testing
 cases assignment, focusing on the direct e
 xperience of each team member, monitored the
 progress of the test cases execution, in terms 
 of the deadline of the regression cycle, 
 quickly responded to the team's questions 
 and overcame obstacles, regularly reported 
 to the team regarding any changes and updates 
 during the cycle.

As a mentor, Arsen explained the material 
intelligibly and in an accessible way during 
my training. He was helping me to understand 
the points that were unclear to me. 
At the same time, Arsen not only consistently 
analyzed the steps to perform the task, 
but also offered different ways to solve the issue. 
It is worth noting that Arsen's mentorship is 
not limited to the internship period, but also 
includes an analysis of the use of tools and 
advanced training of team members during working 
on the project. It is also interesting to mention 
that during new knowledge lectures, Arsen is 
active and asks good and interesting questions 
on the subject, and this is a good demonstration 
of self-skills improvement, and therefore raises 
his mentorship values.
